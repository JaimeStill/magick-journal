# Dreams

This morning, I recalled dreaming. I did not recall any visual scenery associated with it, but purely feeling; a vague sense of a space and momentum.

# Solar FourFold Breath

A short, 10 minute session. I woke up in a bad mood, and have been having a tough time shaking the negativity. I will say that in this moment following meditation, I feel like I have calmed down and am more centered.

# Raising Energy

My bad mood is definitely affecting my ability to raise and control energy. There's something I need to deal with, and I think my mood is just a result of this being unresolved. The more I thought on this, the more I am motivated to learn the Tarot and become proficient at performing divinations. My Golden Dawn Magickal Tarot will arrive any day now, and I will begin the process of integrating it into my daily practice.
