# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke. I'm going to ask for help about this, because I'm not entirely sure what steps I may need to take to be more engaged with my dreams.

# Solar FourFold Breath

My meditation this morning ended abruptly. I really need to get a better grasp on blocking out external stimuli.

After I settled into my meditation, I ended up on a boulder on the side of a mountain. The cliff I rested on overlooked a village that rested right on the edge of the valley and the base of the mountain. As I inhaled, golden red sunlight flooded more and more of the valley below. At a certain point, I was mid-inhale when I realized I was no longer on the boulder, but suspended between 100 - 200 feet above the village absorbing the sunlight flooding into it. My rooster crowed and sucked me directly out of my meditation.

While this may not have been the best result, overall, I feel that I have become very comfortable with the FF meditations. I am going to attempt my first Middle Pillar tonight. I have memorized the phrases and visualizations, as well as practiced vibrating the phrases through me. The evening is when I am best suited for engaging in deeper focus. It just feels like the right time for a moment of growth.

# Raising Energy

When charging my energy this morning, I was able to control and compress the energy with my hands a foot apart from each other. In addition to asking about dreams, I'm also going to ask about additional applications and practices of energy work.

The focus of my energy this morning was for calm and mental clarity, so I decided to infuse my energy into a scented candle that sits on my desk in my office.
