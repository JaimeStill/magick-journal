# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

To preface the intention of this ritual today, I must discuss my morning. I had a horrible anxiety attack that lasted for about an hour. My head was racing with an overload of thoughts, and could not rein them in at all. Even worse, every thought that entered was illustrated in a negative light. I kept moving from a state of frantically pacing circles around my house to trying to find a place of peace to center myself. Eventually, I put in my earbuds and played the [Binaural Beats: Meditation](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Tgh3tlyc3X?si=u_E0ayc7R1q9beP-P_Qvsw) playlist on Spotify and laid down with my arms and legs tucked under my body under the blanket on my daybed in my office / ritual room. This eased me from my frantic state and allowed me to sink into a deep relaxation. Along with this relaxation, my mind was able to focus on a stream of thought at a time, driven by the vibrations of the sound, and my consciousness left my body until it too went to sleep.

In the LBRP ritual, after closing the circle, I asked Gabriel to bring peace to my psyche. There is trauma there that I don't truly understand how to bring healing to, so in the meantime, I'm going to work with the archangels within LBRP to work on it. During my episode this morning, because of all of the meditation and self-reflection I've been engaged with, I was able to stay mentally resilient, not freak out too bad, and ultimately bring myself to center. When I ended my ritual, I felt a sense of calm and peace with myself. In a lot of ways, I believe the anxiety this morning was a result of my coming into a new power, and being afraid of it.
