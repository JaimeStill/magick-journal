# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with Middle Pillar

During today's ritual, I ended up in the tower courtyard at first Qabalistic Cross again. This was the first time I was able to conduct the entire ritual from memory. There was something immensely different about this experience compared to the previous experiences. While performing the LBRP ritual, I felt fragments of energy lifting out of my aura. By the time I closed off the circle, I felt like a weighted blanket was removed from me. After sitting cross-legged in the circle, the presence in the tower actually communicated with me:

> "Focus on building your energy that you may use it to love others. In time, you will grow to know me."

With this, I sat with the presence and spent the entire connected state of Middle Pillar raising and sending energy. I raised and sent more energy in this one session than I had in all of my previous energy work combined. It was absolutely exhilarating. When I finished, I felt like I used a lot of energy, but I was not spent. I feel extremely fulfilled and ready to have an excellent time with **FAM** tonight.
