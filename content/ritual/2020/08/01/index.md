# Dreams

I was in a clean, modern village preparing for some abstract, important event. Everyone in the village that I encountered throughout the dream were people I know from previous phases of my life. Each sequence of the dream just consisted of conversations with different people in different moments. Everything felt calm and peaceful, almost too much so, and I got the impression that we were not in life on Earth any longer.

# Seasonal FourFold Breath

During todays Seasonal FF, I was laying under a grove of trees, watching their transformation synchronized to the rhythm of by breaths. WIth each passing of seasons, I grew more and mroe restless until I envisioned myself in action in each season. In spring, I was climbing rocks on a hillside. In summer, I was playing at a river bank, being refreshed by the cool of the water. In autumn, I was hiking trails under a blazing canopy of trees. In winter, I was gathering firewood in silent, magical woods blanketed with snow.

When I meditated on this following the ritual, I was saddened by the notion that these days, it's hard for people to even engage with the Earth anymore. Everything is either private property, or paid public land with hours, restrictions, crowds, etc. that make personal engagement near impossible. There need to be more public lands where people have the space and freedom to engage with life.
