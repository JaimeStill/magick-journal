# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke.

# Solar FourFold Breath

During meditation this morning, I saw my spirit and it was a flame. At first, it was barely a flicker. As I drew in solar energy with my inhale, fuel was brought into the flame. As I held it in, the fuel caused the flame to rage. With each exhale, the energy from the flame was released. As I held the exhale, this energy wrapped around me and strengthened my aura. After adequately energizing, I opened my eyes and soaked in the peace of the early morning.
