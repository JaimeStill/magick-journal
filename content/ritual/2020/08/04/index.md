# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke.

# Solar FourFold Breath

During meditation this morning, I saw my spirit and it was a flame. At first, it was barely a flicker. As I drew in solar energy with my inhale, fuel was brought into the flame. As I held it in, the fuel caused the flame to rage. With each exhale, the energy from the flame was released. As I held the exhale, this energy wrapped around me and strengthened my aura. After adequately energizing, I opened my eyes and soaked in the peace of the early morning.

# Middle Pillar

My mind was all over the place and it took me longer than usual to settle into meditation. The visuals weren't so much there today, but I was acutely aware of the energy movement. It was the same momentum as the Middle Pillar engagement I had [previously](https://www.magick-journal.com/ritual/2020/07/31/), where energy swarmed around me like electrons. When I connected with the Earth's energy, it felt as if gravity stopped. I was suspended in the void, swarming with a rapidly circulating, heavily vibrating energy. After circulating this energy for a moment, I ended the ritual.

# Raising Energy

I have a very important phone call this afternoon, and the next phase of my path will largely be shaped by it. With this in mind, I infused fairness and articulation into my energy, which I then energized into a simple pen on my desk. In my business dealings, I have always been incredibly fair, often at my own expense. Today, particularly under the environment of the next phase, it's time to ask for what I am worth, and the conditions necessary to be successful.

# Lunar FourFold Breath

I had a lot of deep, emotional realizations tonight during my meditation, as well as an epiphany about the importance of know thyself. I visualized myself in a pool of water under clear skies. The moon was brilliantly hanging above me, bathing me with its energy. As I soaked in its light, I felt a transformation of consciousness not unlike when the effects of a drug begin to take hold. In that moment, I saw myself in a more exposed and vulnerable light. I began to think of how all of the different fears, anxieties, disappointments, embarrassments, all of it came to be so tightly woven into my psyche.

I then started to think about my parents. My parents divorced when I was 5. My mother had me when she was 19 and my father was 28. I thought about how difficult that must have been, and even subconsciously, how I must have been perceived with some semblance of regret (even though neither of them have ever given me any reason to believe this). My father ended up raising me, and things felt great for a while. Unfortunately, after he remarried, he and my stepmom were just stretched too think trying to raise what ended up being 4 boys and a girl. Teenage years were pretty atrocious.

In this meditation, I believe the message was that I need to cleanse myself of this baggage. It is in this that I began to realize the importance of the timeline Damien set. If I had just rushed ahead and haphazardly practiced the LBRP, I would not have had the time to know myself to this degree, and I would not have had the focus of intent for the ritual as clearly as I do now.
