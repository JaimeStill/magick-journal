# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke.

# Solar FourFold Breath

During meditation this morning, I saw my spirit and it was a flame. At first, it was barely a flicker. As I drew in solar energy with my inhale, fuel was brought into the flame. As I held it in, the fuel caused the flame to rage. With each exhale, the energy from the flame was released. As I held the exhale, this energy wrapped around me and strengthened my aura. After adequately energizing, I opened my eyes and soaked in the peace of the early morning.

# Middle Pillar

My mind was all over the place and it took me longer than usual to settle into meditation. The visuals weren't so much there today, but I was acutely aware of the energy movement. It was the same momentum as the Middle Pillar engagement I had [previously](https://www.magick-journal.com/ritual/2020/07/31/), where energy swarmed around me like electrons. When I connected with the Earth's energy, it felt as if gravity stopped. I was suspended in the void, swarming with a rapidly circulating, heavily vibrating energy. After circulating this energy for a moment, I ended the ritual.

# Raising Energy

I have a very important phone call this afternoon, and the next phase of my path will largely be shaped by it. With this in mind, I infused fairness and articulation into my energy, which I then energized into a simple pen on my desk. In my business dealings, I have always been incredibly fair, often at my own expense. Today, particularly under the environment of the next phase, it's time to ask for what I am worth, and the conditions necessary to be successful.
