# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

I'm starting to feel a deeper connection with this ritual. It feels like it is really cleansing the negative energy out of my aura and giving me a degree of patience and foresight that I have never had before. Tonight was the perfect example. I had just closed the circle and was about to begin the Middle Pillar, but my family came home and were extremely loud outside of my office. Under normal circumstances, I would have been incredibly frustrated and on the verge of losing my cool. Today, however, I didn't even flinch or feel an acceleration in my heartbeat. Instead, I just sat cross-legged and performed the radiant divine fire breath and raised energy. Energy was sent out to two of my friends.

I did end up in the tower courtyard again today, and when it came time to raise energy for myself, I asked the tower presence to infuse their energy into mine. When the energy vibrations were incredibly powerful, I infused it into my golden sphere.

# Notes

Tomorrow, I am spending an hour in one of those immersion float tanks. Everything I've heard about them says that they are an intense experience. I'm still conflicted about whether I will conduct a formal ritual, or if I will just allow the experience to be a ritual unto itself. If I do decide to, I'll be performing the Middle Pillar. Excited for this experience, and to share it when complete.
