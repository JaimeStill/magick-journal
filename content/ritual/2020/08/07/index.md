# Dreams

Five years from now, not only did I end up successfully finishing the project that I'm currently working on, my team ended up being recruited to do some really meaningful, intense work. The right people caught wind of what we are capable of, and carved out an entire segment of their tech section to accommodate our capabilities. In the dream, we had just finished a very difficult project for this customer, but our team had grown exponentially from when we started. I adopted a scaled out strategy for recruiting within and training new engineers to be able to contribute to our projects. A few of our friends that we know had already been integrated through this process. Our team had the freedom / leverage to do what was needed for our projects to get accomplished. At the end of this project, we were tasked by the government to create a new agency to be run as a tech company and our first initiative was to standardize and build out the recruiting and training processes that lead to our success.

# Solar FourFold Breath

My mind felt so at ease during the ritual today. It feels like the break I had last night gave me the appropriate time to digest all of the things my mind was chewing on. As I sank into meditation, I found myself laying in the grass on a clear summer day. The warmth of the morning sun radiated around me and I felt a clean connection to this energy. Once the energy connection reached full strength, I felt my consciousness detach and center between the Sun and my physical body. Where my consciousness rested, the solar energy poured through me and down to my physical body. After a few moments, the solar connection began to recede, my consciousness slowly settled back down into my body, and I ended my ritual.

> At that time all mankind spoke a single language. As the population grew and spread eastward, a plain was discovered in the land of Babylon and was soon thickly populated. The people who lived there began to talk about building a great city, with a temple-tower reaching to the skies - a proud, eternal monument to themselves.
>
> "This will weld us together," they said, "and keep us from scattering all over the world." So they made great piles of hard-burned brick, and collected bitumen to use as mortar.
>
> But when God came down to see the city and the tower mankind was making, he said, "Look! If they are able to accomplish all this when they have just *begun* to exploit their linguistic and political unity, just think of what they will do later! Nothing will be unattainable for them! Come, let us go down and give them different languages, so that they won't understand each other's words!"
>
> So, in that way, God scattered them all over the earth; and that ended the building of the city. That is why the city was called Babel (meaning "confusion"), because it was there that Jehovah confused them by giving them many languages, thus widely scattering them across the face of the earth.

> *Genesis 11:1-9*

* This card gives me a great sense of unease. It gives me the sense that I should be very careful in my communications and not try to shake things up too much.
