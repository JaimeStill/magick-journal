# Dreams

Five years from now, not only did I end up successfully finishing the project that I'm currently working on, my team ended up being recruited to do some really meaningful, intense work. The right people caught wind of what we are capable of, and carved out an entire segment of their tech section to accommodate our capabilities. In the dream, we had just finished a very difficult project for this customer, but our team had grown exponentially from when we started. I adopted a scaled out strategy for recruiting within and training new engineers to be able to contribute to our projects. A few of our friends that we know had already been integrated through this process. Our team had the freedom / leverage to do what was needed for our projects to get accomplished. At the end of this project, we were tasked by the government to create a new agency to be run as a tech company and our first initiative was to standardize and build out the recruiting and training processes that lead to our success.
