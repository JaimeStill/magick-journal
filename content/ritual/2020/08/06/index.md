# Solar FourFold Breath

I need to focus on the fundamentals. My head has been so distracted lately. This morning, I turned on the album Magma by Gojira and just let the batteries recharge. In the moments I was aware to do so, I pulled in solar energy, but I didn't force it. I think a lot of my exhaustion lately stems from how concentrated I have been combined with how chaotic my mind normally is. It takes a lot of effort that I'm not used to expending.

# Charging Water

This morning, I was reading through Damien's discussion in High Magick on charging water through a revised Middle Pillar ritual. I decided, given the minor slump I've found myself in the last couple of days, that this would be a beneficial ritual to practice. Particularly since my energy detection and control have been so high lately. After establishing a connection between Divinity and Earth in the golden sphere, I charged this energy with two parts: infusing positivity and energy, and protecting against negativity and fatigue. With each inhale, I felt this energy swarm into the golden sphere. With each exhale, I felt the energy flow out of my hands and into the glass of water. I ended the ritual by slowly sipping the water until it was gone.

# Notes

I ended up taking the evening off last night, but in doing so, found a very deep truth about magick. Magick can be found in any moment, regardless of whether you are performing a ritual or just being present in a moment. My son and I hung out watching the FX show Cake on Hulu last night, and it was exactly what I needed to allow my brain to recharge. I'm going to start paying much more attention to how I'm feeling and, if needed, take breaks. I'm going to stay committed to learning at least one new thing and practicing at least one ritual each day on the break days. If that's the case, I will highlight any insights gained outside of rituals in a notes section like this. So the big lesson for this break was that magick is in every moment. The degree to which we engage with it is purely based on our mindfulness of what magick is in the first place.
