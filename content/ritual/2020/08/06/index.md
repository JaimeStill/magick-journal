# Solar FourFold Breath

I need to focus on the fundamentals. My head has been so distracted lately. This morning, I turned on the album Magma by Gojira and just let the batteries recharge. In the moments I was aware to do so, I pulled in solar energy, but I didn't force it. I think a lot of my exhaustion lately stems from how concentrated I have been combined with how chaotic my mind normally is. It takes a lot of effort that I'm not used to expending.

# Charging Water

This morning, I was reading through Damien's discussion in High Magick on charging water through a revised Middle Pillar ritual. I decided, given the minor slump I've found myself in the last couple of days, that this would be a beneficial ritual to practice. Particularly since my energy detection and control have been so high lately. After establishing a connection between Divinity and Earth in the golden sphere, I charged this energy with two parts: infusing positivity and energy, and protecting against negativity and fatigue. With each inhale, I felt this energy swarm into the golden sphere. With each exhale, I felt the energy flow out of my hands and into the glass of water. I ended the ritual by slowly sipping the water until it was gone.
