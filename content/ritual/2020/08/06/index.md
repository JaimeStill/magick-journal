# Solar FourFold Breath

I need to focus on the fundamentals. My head has been so distracted lately. This morning, I turned on the album Magma by Gojira and just let the batteries recharge. In the moments I was aware to do so, I pulled in solar energy, but I didn't force it. I think a lot of my exhaustion lately stems from how concentrated I have been combined with how chaotic my mind normally is. It takes a lot of effort that I'm not used to expending.
