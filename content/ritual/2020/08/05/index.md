# Dreams

I entered into a cycle where an entire lifetime passed over the course of a day, yet my core being persisted beyond each day. I retained all of the growth and knowledge that ocurred over the span of that day. Ultimately, I gained the ability to traverse the Tree of Life.

# Solar FourFold Breath

Not a lot of visualization in my meditation this morning. Again, more of a sensitivity to the energies flowing around me. I noticed how clean and peaceful the aura is in my home office / ritual room now. It is a very welcoming, safe place for me to be in. I was attempting to reach into an altered consciousness, as experienced in previous rituals. Unfortunately, I ended up relinquishing a bit too much and ended up in a dream state of which I have no recollection.
