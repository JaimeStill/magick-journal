# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with Middle Pillar

During the archangel phase of LBRP, I felt compelled after invoking each of them, to really take a pause and acknowledge and appreciate their presence. Too often, I've found myself just sort of bringing them into the circle and moving on without showing any appreciation, and that's entirely unfair. From now on, they will be shown appropriate reverence and gratitude.

In the middle of my magic circle, my body was in a pose similar to child's pose in yoga, but with my head in my upward facing palms. I sat in meditation for about 10 minutes in the tower courtyard I tend to find myself. I heard my consciousness say, "To find your way, all you have to do is elevate your mind." With that, I took a deep inhale, and my conscious body passed through the floor of the courtyard into a cave. Within the cave, I found myself in the presence of a wolf spirit consuming evil energy. I consumed and became the wolf spirit, and hunted out all of the negative energy until it was all gone. In that moment, I felt a burden lift, and I emerged in a golden aura back to my body at the courtyard. In this moment shortly after closing the ritual, my mind feels extremely clear and my body is radiating with a potent, glowing energy.

# Notes

This morning, I found myself dealing with stressful feelings associated with a moment I needed to adequately think through. I'm now in a position where I have to evaluate whether or not people would be an appropriate fit for the team I lead. The initial discomfort of my decision having a direct impact on a persons livelihood was initially daunting, but I took the time to objectively consider the information I had. I also realized that these people would most likely not have a problem finding employment outside of my team, and that I needed to trust my gut with regard to them being a proper fit.

I reached for my copy of Angels & Archangels looking for the archangel associated with clear communication, but when I opened the book, I found myself on the page of **Ambriel, Archangel of Gemini**. I happen to be a Gemini, as well as a software engineer, and the description of this archangel could not have been more fitting:

> The third sign of hte zodiac is Gemini, which begins on May 21 and ends on June 20. The archangel who presides here is Ambriel, the great communicator. As such, his energy is greatly entwined with technology in the modern age, especially social media and the internet. Ambriel can help us understand and articulate abstract concepts to others in a way that their minds can grasp. He is the patron archangel of writers, public speakers, and computer programmers - all people who are immersed in the business of sharing and disseminating knowledge.

After studying this archangel, I spent a moment before lunch in meditation invoking Ambriel to help guide my communications this week, and lead me to success in my endeavors in a way that brings harm to no one.
