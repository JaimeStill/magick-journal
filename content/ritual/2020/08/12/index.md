# Notes

I'm pretty sure that I burned out my meridians with the huge work that I did yesterday. Per High Magick:

> Much like veins and arteries, meridians transport nourishment and power, but instead of blood and oxygen the meridians are conduits for energy. You can build up the ability to move more energy through your meridians, but it takes time, just as it does to build muscle, gain strength and endurance, and enhance the performance of your physical body. But before that happens, you can temporarily fry your system. It only lasts a few days, but it can be disheartening to say the last. The good news is that when your meridians repair themselves, they come back much stronger than before.

With this in mind, I'll be doing nothing but breathing meditations until Saturday when I perform my first Qabalistic Cross ritual.

Additionally, during my morning walk with my friend, I was discussing the dream and premonition I had yesterday about the dissolution of the physical self, and the evolution of reality through the creation of my own pocket universe. There arrived two notions I want to remember:

* Whether the reality and situations we find ourselves in during dreams are truly another reality, or just a way for our minds to process information that doesn't make sense to our conscious mind.

* Life in the physical reality could actually be hell and failing to achieve the solar body in a lifetime results in reincarnation rather than ascendance.
