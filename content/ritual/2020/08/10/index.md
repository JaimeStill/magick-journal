# Solar FourFold Breath

This morning's ritual felt familiar to my previous engagements with solar breathing. A very clean, energetic golden charge to the aura. THe biggest difference this time was that I could feel the stream of energy concentrated at my golden energy sphere. It still surrounded and permeated my aura, but the main line of energy pushed through further and directly into the sphere. I get the feeling it has to do with my meditation pose. Rather than lying down, I sat cross-legged and upright. I really think this does a lot to optimize breathing and energy flow.
