# Solar FourFold Breath

This morning's ritual felt familiar to my previous engagements with solar breathing. A very clean, energetic golden charge to the aura. THe biggest difference this time was that I could feel the stream of energy concentrated at my golden energy sphere. It still surrounded and permeated my aura, but the main line of energy pushed through further and directly into the sphere. I get the feeling it has to do with my meditation pose. Rather than lying down, I sat cross-legged and upright. I really think this does a lot to optimize breathing and energy flow.

# Middle Pillar and Raising Energy

I approached Middle Pillar with a heavy heart and a deep sense of unease. Being a parent is probably one of the most helpless experiences a person can endure. Particularly when you are a step parent who has taken on the role of father for teenagers who have had a rather turbulent upbringing. The decisions they choose to make, as well as their willful ignorance of the wisdom you try to impart, are enough to break even those with the strongest fortitude. Before I could even begin the Middle Pillar ritual, I had to sit zazen for an hour to calm down.

Today with the first time I intentionally invoked an archangel. I simply asked for Michael to bring protection to our home and our family. While I did not see or hear any confirmation of this invocation, I certainly felt a dramatic shift in the energy of the room as Middle Pillar began. The healing energy of the ritual was so powerful that I didn't have the capacity for visualization. It was sort of like closing your eyes in the shower and just feeling the water stream down your body.

When I connected to the Earth's energy, I generated an energy ball filled with wisdom and courageous intent. I also sealed it with protection from ignorance and folly. When it was about a foot across and powerful, I pressed my palms against the ground and prayed to Yeshua. I prayed that the energy would meet my son with powerful intent, and allow him to find his true path to the glory of the Divine. Thus ended the ritual.

# Notes

On Monday entries, I will not be conducting ritual in the evening. Instead, I will be attending Fellowship of Advancing Magi meetings. The fellowship and experiences developed through these meetings have been instrumental in orienting magick and finding deeper purpose. I would consider this activity as impactful as the Middle Pillar has been for strengthening and cleaning my energy.

Additionally, after the Middle Pillar and Raising Energy ritual from yesterday, the entire family situation I was dealing with yesterday dissolved peacefully and with great love and impact.
