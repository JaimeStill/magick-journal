# Dreams

I was wandering a wasteland full of ghostly premonitions in the corridors of abandoned buildings. With one of my friends, we wandered from building to building in search of something unknown to us. The buildings were full of elevators that lead to bizarre realms. There were beings to be found, but none human. The longer we existed in this space, the more I began to realize that we were no longer alive.

# Notes

Something very strange happened last night in addition to a weird dream I had. In my sleep, I felt this bright white energy inside of me, and it was building up like a charge. Then, it just started pulsing out of me. To the point where I was awake, my torso was elevated 45 degrees off of the bed, and my muscles were pulsing with the energy bursts. I haven't felt energy that powerful at any point before. Reflecting on it, I feel fine. Even when it was happening, I was half-conscious but I was calm inside. Just in awe at how powerful it was.

Confiding this experience with my friend, she shared a reading:

> Awakening of the kundalini can be described in many different ways but, in essence, it represents the pinnacle of spiritual progress, or samadhi, the ultimate inner awareness that finds complete union with the divine. ... The end result after your kundalini has been awakened: ultimate freedom.

Reading through [Our Light Body: A Kundalini Awakening Testimonial](https://ourlightbody.com/index.php/part-iii-human-metamorphosis/chapter-6-all-about-kundalini/kundalini-awakening-symptoms?fbclid=IwAR1phv-TtAPwlMxI9V4qBsVSFiKeIjUVDIVdb3ObZV014PgCwB4-7-2D0HE), the **Pre-Awakening Symptoms** are spot on to the experiences I've been having over the past month:

> The kinds of symptoms faced when near pre-awakening often are due to changes occurring in the mind. Visions, vivid dreams, insights, synchronistic events, seeing the world differently and many changes in perspectives and beliefs occur. There is often a questioning of ideas and beliefs about God and religion that you have held your entire lifetime. Energy is working in your mind to clear aspects about how you see yourself and how you see the world. In short, your eyes are opening as your mind quiets down and when you look outside you discover that everything is conscious. Sporadic nervous system reactions also occur.

This evening, I got to connect on a deeper level with a fellow magician I deeply admire and look up to. It's incredible how connected we are to people when we can be honest and humble in our approach to humanity. No manipulative intentions or looking for anything more than a real, meaningful connection with another person. I'm sure we will have many more great conversations. A piece of sage wisdom I will never forget: the ultimate state is that of a child at play.
