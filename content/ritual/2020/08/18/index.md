# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

This LBRP was completely about banishing the negative energy and getting back to center, and it really worked. I spent a bit more time focused on the energy of the archangels, and getting in tune with their presence. After closing the circle, I spent some time performing the radiant divine fire breath and building up the energy inside of my body and my aura. Before closing the ritual with the final Qabalistic Cross, I spoke favors to each of the archangels in ways that would harm no one.

# Notes

I don't know what my deal is, but all afternoon / evening I've been in the most rotten mood. Lot's of self doubt and negative thought patterns that I know are bullshit. I'm just having to use a ton of energy to repel it and work up motivation to do ritual.

I've been feeling it coming on like storm clouds on the horizon the past couple of days, and today it was just like "it's the day."

Talking to a good friend definitely helps, and practicing magick is absolutely instrumental in enforcing the death of the ego. It's mad for me trying to kill it, and it doesn't want to die. It's mad that I'm finding my higher self.
