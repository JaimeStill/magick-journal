# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

I feel like the more I engage with this ritual, the more effective it is at not just banishing negative energy, but pushing me closer to killing my Ego and allowing my higher self to take over. Ever since I started performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, it feels like I've begun some sort of trial. Wave after wave of negativity, misfortune, and just overall rough circumstances have been taking place. No matter how trying the situation is, I've been able to stay cool and collected. I'm aware of the fact that I'm frustrated and not optimally energized, but I do not allow it to unravel me. I'm simply able to acknowledge it and ride out the storm.

Today, I did not find myself at the tower. Instead, I found myself in a pitch black pocket of the universe, surrounded only by the four archangels I called to protect the circle. For whatever reason, I did not feel compelled to invoke Metatron or Sandalphon. I sat in my circle and engaged in the radiant divine fire breath in order to build up my energy. I felt compelled to direct energy to two key co-workers that I feel are in need of this gift. In one of the cases, with my co-worker who is also one of my best friends who I trust immensely, I was had a strong feeling that I should ask him to directly receive the energy. This is the message I sent him following the ritual:

> I'm going to ask you to do something, and it may seem super weird, but I think of anyone, you will trust me.
>
> At some point when you have a free moment, I am going to ask you to engage in a meditation to receive energy that I infused with some meaningful things and attuned to your energy signature. I'm not going to make any assumptions about what will happen, I'm just going to ask that you follow the following steps:
>
> 1. In a dark room, orient yourself east and either stand or sit cross-legged, whatever is comfortable for you. Close your eyes.
>
> 2. For as long as you need to, engage your breathing in the following pattern:
>
>     * Inhale 4 seconds
>     * Hold 4 seconds
>     * Exhale 4 seconds
>     * No pause between exhale and inhale
>     * Do this until your mind is still and free of distraction
>
> 3. Envision a radiant beam of white light cast down from the top of the universe directly to you, connecting to a golden sphere in your chest.
>
> 4. Envision a beam of green light flowing up from the core of the Earth through the point where you are anchored to the ground, and connecting to the golden sphere in your chest.
>
> 5. Imagine with every 4 second inhale, energy is being pulled like fluid through a straw from the divine energy above, and the energy of the Earth below. This energy meets in the golden sphere in your chest and vibrates with a brilliant gold intensity.
>
> 6. As you hold your breath for 4 seconds, imagine this energy condensing into an infinitely small point within the sphere.
>
> 7. As you exhale for 4 seconds, imagine this energy exploding through you and filling a space 3 feet around you in all directions. When you inhale next, this energy will remain surrounding you.
>
>     * Repeat steps 5 through 7 until the energy is solid and you feel it can grow no stronger
>
> 8. Clap your hands and slowly return your mind back to a state of awareness.
>
> In order for this to work, you have to cast aside all doubt.

After I sent the energy out to my co-workers, I generated a ball of energy for myself, asking for inspiration, motivation, and wisdom. When the ball was strong and intense, I infused it into the gold sphere in my chest. Before closing out with the Qabalistic Cross, I said a prayer to Yeshua that all of these things be done to guide us towards the right path in a way that brings harm to no one.

As soon as this ritual was complete, I felt like all of the negativity and frustration had been washed away from me. My mind was refocused and I felt centered with the energies around me.
