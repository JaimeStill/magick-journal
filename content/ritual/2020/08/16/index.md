# Full Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with Middle Pillar

As I expanded out to begin the Qabalistic Cross, I immediately entered the tower courtyard and felt the presence residing there. The ritual today gave no further indication to who or what this presence is, but there was more interaction with the presence. I was able to complete the pentagrams from memory fully, but had to revert to my cheat sheet for the archangels and sealing the circle. I know the general information pertaining to these sections, but there's just that vague degree of uncertainty that I will mess something up. I remember all of the words and names, I just don't want to miss any steps.

The energy from the archangels was not as prevalent today as it was yesterday, but I could definitely identify their presence. When I started moving the energy for the Middle Pillar, I felt the tower presence directing the energy down through my spheres. When connecting with the Earth's energy, I performed the fire breath and drew upon all available sources (to include the tower presence) to charge energy into the golden sphere. On each exhale, I gradually extended the radius of the energy until it filled the entire courtyard of the tower.

When the tower was full of energy, I sat cross-legged within the circle and raised energy into four large energy balls that I directed towards friends and family. I was able to start the energy balls with my hands much further apart today, and the intensity and energy control was a lot better than it has ever been prior to this point. After sending out the energy, I felt compelled to lay and engage in a series of Radiant Divine Fire Breath. While performing this breathing, I felt the tower presence over me and washing out my aura. Once this was complete, I rose to my feet and closed the ritual with the ending Qabalistic Cross.

# Notes

My new ritual schedule is primarily going to focus on a daily Full Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with at least a Middle Pillar conducted within the protective sphere. Once this ritual becomes second nature, I will attempt the Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram. In addition to this longer ritual, I will be performing at least 15 minutes of breathing meditations in the morning and in the evening.
