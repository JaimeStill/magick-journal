# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke. I'm going to ask for help about this, because I'm not entirely sure what steps I may need to take to be more engaged with my dreams.

# Solar FourFold Breath

My meditation this morning ended abruptly. I really need to get a better grasp on blocking out external stimuli.

After I settled into my meditation, I ended up on a boulder on the side of a mountain. The cliff I rested on overlooked a village that rested right on the edge of the valley and the base of the mountain. As I inhaled, golden red sunlight flooded more and more of the valley below. At a certain point, I was mid-inhale when I realized I was no longer on the boulder, but suspended between 100 - 200 feet above the village absorbing the sunlight flooding into it. My rooster crowed and sucked me directly out of my meditation.

While this may not have been the best result, overall, I feel that I have become very comfortable with the FF meditations. I am going to attempt my first Middle Pillar tonight. I have memorized the phrases and visualizations, as well as practiced vibrating the phrases through me. The evening is when I am best suited for engaging in deeper focus. It just feels like the right time for a moment of growth.

# Raising Energy

When charging my energy this morning, I was able to control and compress the energy with my hands a foot apart from each other. In addition to asking about dreams, I'm also going to ask about additional applications and practices of energy work.

The focus of my energy this morning was for calm and mental clarity, so I decided to infuse my energy into a scented candle that sits on my desk in my office.

# Middle Pillar

Before I started the ritual, I spent some time re-reading the whole section for the initial Middle Pillar ritual in *High Magick*. When complete, I spent a few moments engaged in the relaxation ritual from *Modern Magick*. After a few moments of working towards a meditative state, I arose and allowed myself to settle into the feeling of the standing position.

I allowed my mind to zoom out from the Earth, out past the Solar System, beyond the Milky Way, and visualized a brilliant beam of white light piercing through the top of the observable universe. I followed the beam as it descended all the way down to where I stood until it formed a sphere of bright white energy a foot in diameter at the top of my head. With each of my inhalations, the sphere's energy strength and vibration intensity drastically increased. Upon vibrating the mantra, **EHEIEH**, the sphere exploded, and rays of energy surrounded the sphere in all directions. The vibration felt really good, which I feel may be attributed to the fact that I have a deep, booming voice. Each subsequent vibration exploded more and more energy out from the sphere.

I continued the ritual through the remaining four spheres, each resulting in brilliant rays of colored energy spilling out from the spheres. I spent about five minutes tethered between the pure, cleansing light of divinity, and the calm, comforting green glow of Earth's energy. After breaking the ritual, I felt my aura vibrating with a euphoric, peaceful energy. I took a moment to stand on my porch and bask in the beauty of Saturn, Jupiter, and a super fat Waxing Gibbous Moon lined up in the sky right in front of me.
