# Dreams

This morning, I recalled dreaming. I did not recall any visual scenery associated with it, but purely feeling; a vague sense of a space and momentum.

# Solar FourFold Breath

A short, 10 minute session. I woke up in a bad mood, and have been having a tough time shaking the negativity. I will say that in this moment following meditation, I feel like I have calmed down and am more centered.

# Raising Energy

My bad mood is definitely affecting my ability to raise and control energy. There's something I need to deal with, and I think my mood is just a result of this being unresolved. The more I thought on this, the more I am motivated to learn the Tarot and become proficient at performing divinations. My Golden Dawn Magickal Tarot will arrive any day now, and I will begin the process of integrating it into my daily practice.

# Middle Pillar

When visualizing the flow of energy, I detached from my body and, in relation to this new perspective, it was as tall as a mountain. While I could still feel the flow of energy in this detached state, I focused on each energy sphere; bathing in its explosive radiance when vibrating the mantras. Traveling down from sphere to sphere felt like being gently lowered as if a current of pressure were holding me in place. This felt similar to the notion of riding drafts of air when paragliding.  

When I connected to the Earth's energy sphere, this current propelled me upward in a spiral around my body until I reached the radiant white sphere, then gently lowered me back down to the glowing black sphere at my feet. After ending the ritual, all of the negativity from this morning dissolved, and I feel calm and focused.

# Lunar FourFold Breath

I tried something a little different tonight and performed the meditation to the song *Pneuma* by the band [Tool](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yEwvVSSSUkcLeSTNyHKh8?si=dgIBgJQ8S6G3OaxB_VrjiA).

When I laid down, I settled right into a peaceful meditation. The middle pillar from lunchtime really set me into a centered state of calm.The lunar energy tonight brought me back to nights in the Army smoking cigarettes out under the Milky Way. Knowing what I know now, the mystical magick of those moments makes a lot more sense. It also leads me to an understanding of how magick, in the subconscious sense, helped me navigate and survive 8 years of that chaos. I was fortunate to have not been sent to the Middle East, though at the time I didn't see it that way. As much as I wanted to go at the time, the Army never sent me. For a long time, I was very insecure about this because I felt that I wasn't able to do my part where so many others had. I've come to appreciate the aspects of the service I was (and in many regards, am still) engaged in. It was in this moment reflecting on these times that the song reached its final spoken verse:

```
Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, eyes full of wonder
```

Following this, a huge weight lift off of my shoulders and a true sense of healing wash over. Tonight was such an amazing moment, and I am thankful that I've made it this far to experience it.
