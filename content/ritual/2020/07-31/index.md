# Dreams

I awoke holding on to the phrase: need to help the world. I didn't recall anything else beyond that, but I was aware of the fact that I had dreamt. This is definitely progress.

# Solar FourFold Breath

My meditation this morning was relaxing and enjoyable. No strong visualization today, but I did find the very edge of a different state of consciousness. A state of mind on the border of awake and asleep. I wanted to sink further into it, but I had to get ready for work. This is definitely a place I need to explore further.
