# Solar FourFold Breath

As I settled into visualization, I saw the 5 energy spheres of the Middle Pillar for the first time. I've been actively working towards memorizing the location, color, and phrase associated with each sphere, so I used that as a means of sinking into meditation. With each inhale, I would say a part of the phrase. Eventually, I reached a state where with each inhale, solar light flooded and cleansed the sphere corresponding to the phrase. At the end of this, I offered out a prayer. "Forgive me for the negative energy I have directed toward you in anger. I have been blind and ignorant, which has caused me to misguide my anger. I seek reconciliation ask for the strength and wisdom to stay the path, that I may achieve your purpose."
