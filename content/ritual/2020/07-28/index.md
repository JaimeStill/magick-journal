# Dreams

I did not recall any dreams when I awoke. It seems that the frequency with which I remember dreams has tapered off drastically over the last few years. Dreams are definitely something I want to get back in touch with, because I feel they can have great insights.

# Solar FourFold Breath

As I settled into visualization, I saw the 5 energy spheres of the Middle Pillar for the first time. I've been actively working towards memorizing the location, color, and phrase associated with each sphere, so I used that as a means of sinking into meditation. With each inhale, I would say a part of the phrase. Eventually, I reached a state where with each inhale, solar light flooded and cleansed the sphere corresponding to the phrase. At the end of this, I offered out a prayer. "Forgive me for the negative energy I have directed toward you in anger. I have been blind and ignorant, which has caused me to misguide my anger. I seek reconciliation ask for the strength and wisdom to stay the path, that I may achieve your purpose."

Below is my study card for the Middle Pillar:

`YHVH (Yehowah) Eloah Va Daath` | yay-ho-wah el-oh-ah va da-ath | Of Knowledge and Wisdom | Gold | Noonday Sun / Conscious Mind
`Shaddai El Chai` | shad-eye el kai | The Almighty | Purple | Subconscious Mind
`Adonai Ha Aretz` | ah-don-eye ha ah-retz | Lord of the Earth | Black | Physical Body

# Walking Meditation

I spent about an hour in my backyard, aimlessly walking and soaking up the energy of dusk. The past two days, I have been pouring myself into work, and I realized that I just needed to disconnect from it all and recharge the batteries. Working a job, studying and practicing magick, and being devoted to family is extremely time consuming, but each aspect is extremely important. In addition, I still need to take time for myself and be immersed in the outdoors.

# Raising Energy

I'm going to start raising and transferring energy into a single item twice a day at this point. Not just for the practice, but because it is powerful. I charged a particular item with the intent of bringing peace and relaxation, and that is exactly what I got.

# Lunar FourFold Breath

Tonight I felt like I was a lot to handle mentally. It was really hard to get to meditation, and my mind was just scattering a million directions. It was like I had to wrestle myself into submission, and finally once I got there, all I could do was just bask in the stillness. I was sitting cross-legged in a calm body of water that expanded in every direction infinitely. The only thing to give me indication that I was anywhere to begin was was the bright moon casting a single massive beam of reflective light across the water and into my body. The only thing it allowed of me was to rest and feel its energy.
