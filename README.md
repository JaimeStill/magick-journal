# Welcome!

My name is Jaime, and I recently fell into studying and practicing high magick. Coming from someone raised in the Lutheran church in Texas, I'm aware of how bizarre that may sound, but if life has taught me anything, it's that our parents weren't right about everything, and you have to look beyond the surface of something to discover what it is truly about. 

It all started when I watched [Damien Echols'](https://damienechols.com/) episode of [The Midnight Gospel](http://www.duncantrussell.com/midnightgospel-damienechols). Looking back, I could not tell you specifically what spoke to me about that episode, I just knew I had to look more into who Damien Echols is and the magick that he has dedicated his life to.
